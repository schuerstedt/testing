# A Nice Poem

In the morning light I wake  
To see the world anew.  
Each day, a chance to create,  
And make my dreams come true.  

Birds singing sweetly in the trees,  
A gentle breeze blows by.  
Nature's beauty all around me,  
I feel alive, I sigh.  

Life is fleeting, brief and bright,  
So let us make it count.  
Embrace each moment with delight,  
Make memories that amount.  

May your days be filled with joy,  
And your heart be light and free.  
May your life be like a buoy,  
Riding waves of harmony.
